# Logic Pad

A modern web app to create custom Logic Grid puzzles from Islands of Insight.

This is intended as an unofficial companion to Islands of Insight, allowing you to create and play custom puzzles.
It is not a replacement of the full game.
You are strongly recommended to discover the grid rules in-game before using Logic Pad.

Note that this app is still early in development and major refactors are planned.

## Developing Logic Pad

Node.js v18 is required for this project.
I recommend using [Volta](https://volta.sh/) to set up your JS dev environment.

```bash
# 1. Install yarn
npm install -g yarn

# 2. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/hlysine/logic-pad.git

# 3. Restore dependencies
cd logic-pad
yarn

# 4. Run the dev server
yarn dev
```
